# üéóÔ∏è Reminder

`yamlfixer` has been created based on [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) :

> The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. 

So keep in mind that philsophy :

‚òëÔ∏è do not ask `yamlfixer` to implement more and more features it has not to deal with
‚úîÔ∏è focus on command lines and other tools you can plus before or after `yamlfixer` like [`|`](https://youtu.be/bKzonnwoR2I), [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/),[`sed`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed), `awk`, [`gomplate`](https://docs.gomplate.ca/) or [`ytt`](https://carvel.dev/ytt/) ... operators

# ‚ùî Ask for command line

Please detall a use case you would like to achieve thanks to `yamlfixer`.

Our answser could be a oneLiner (see #33) or a script anr rely on others [**single purpose**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well) third party tools
